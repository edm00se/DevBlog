  <p>
	M-V-C (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model - View - Controller</a>) "...is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from the user."
  </p>
  <p>
	These posts cover the conceptual application architecture and some of the implementation. It is my belief that M-V-C application design patterns can lead to a much cleaner and easy to maintain application; especailly with large and complex applications that need to integrate with other systems or applications.

  <h2 id="seriesTitle" style="color: #c91b26">REST with Domino/XPages</h2>
  <p>
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> (REpresentational State Transfer) "...is an abstraction of the architecture of the World Wide Web; more precisely, REST is an architectural style consisting of a coordinated set of architectural constraints applied to components, connectors, and data elements, within a distributed hypermedia system."
  </p>
  <p>
	These posts cover the use and implementation of RESTful interaction with the Domino server.
