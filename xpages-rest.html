	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> stands for REpresentational State Transfer, which "...is an abstraction of the architecture of the World Wide Web; more precisely, REST is an architectural style consisting of a coordinated set of architectural constraints applied to components, connectors, and data elements, within a distributed hypermedia system."

	These posts cover the use and implementation of RESTful interaction with the Domino server.
