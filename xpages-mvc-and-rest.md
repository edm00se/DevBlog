  <h2 id="seriesTitle" class="series-title">M-V-C with Domino/XPages</h2>
	M-V-C (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model - View - Controller</a>) "...is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from the user."

	These posts cover the conceptual application architecture and some of the implementation. It is my belief that M-V-C application design patterns can lead to a much cleaner and easy to maintain application; especailly with large and complex applications that need to integrate with other systems or applications.
