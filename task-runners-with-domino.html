  <p>
	Task runners are a set of tools to make build operations consistent, clean, and well documented. They effectively provide a set of helper tasks to process defined operations on the project via the command line; these are things a human could otherwise accomplish, but are best automated.
  </p>
  <p>
    The two most popular task runners (both JavaScript based) are <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> and <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp</a>. Both of these tools are powerful and useful, each with some advantages and a couple caveats.
  </p>
  <p>
	These posts cover the conceptual, implementation of, and rammifcations regarding use of a task runner to process static web content for optimized asset delivery in a web application, including how to hook into a (properly structured) app for Domino/XPages.
