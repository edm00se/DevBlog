  <h2 id="seriesTitle" style="color: #c91b26">Task Runners with Domino Apps</h2>
  <p>
	Task runners are a set of tools to make build operations consistent, clean, and well documented. They effectively provide a set of helper tasks to process defined operations on the project via the command line; these are things a human could otherwise accomplish, but are best automated.
  </p>
  <p>
    The two most popular task runners (both JavaScript based) are <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> and <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp</a>. Both of these tools are powerful and useful, each with some advantages and a couple caveats.
