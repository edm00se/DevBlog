This is the repository for my blog chronicling my shared trials, tribulations, and triumphs in the world of Lotus/IBM Domino/XPages and more. Any more major file resources I have will be hosted here in a (hopefully) logical folder structure. To read the blog, please visit [edm00se.github.io/DevBlog/](http://edm00se.github.io/DevBlog/).
