I have an passion for application structure, RESTful API design, embracing M-V-C for its benefits, integrating development environments, automating tasks, and making leaner, faster applications for end users.

When I'm not developing for a Java-heavy Domino back-end, I like to develop with Node.js + Express. I love creating front-ends for my applications in Angular, as I love focusing on the data and letting my markup (in my HTML partials) be _only_ markup (a theme which carries true with my avid adoption of managed beans on Domino).

I am not perfect in anything, but I am always learning and welcome the input of others. The XPages community took me in when I came to the Domino platform and I try to give back when I can; in this blog, through various other projects, Notes in 9 videos, and speaking at conferences.

I was [named an IBM Champion for 2015](/self-promotion/they-made-me-a-champion) [and 2016](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/ibmchampion/entry/Announcing_the_IBM_Champion_Class_of_2016_for_IBM_Social_Business?lang=en) (in Collaboration Solutions).
