### In Case You Missed It...
[My last post, recapping my session at MWLUG]({{ site.url }}/self-promotion/mwlug-ad113-success/), managed to get missed in my first tweet of the link. I updated the previous post (announcing my session at MWLUG) with a link at the top, but some may have missed it. Please check it out, there's a link to my slide deck, GitHub repository with my configs, screen shots of my configs in use, and (you guessed it) my slide deck.
