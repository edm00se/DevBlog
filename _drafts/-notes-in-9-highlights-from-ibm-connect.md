### Intro
I'm on Notes in 9 again. This time, I'm back with a video highlighting my session from IBM Connect. I tried to make things easier as far as the time frame, but it's still got a bit of a runtime to it; before submitting it to David Leedy, it came in at 29 minutes and 55 seconds, and that's after I trimmed down every loading screen or dependency install (of which there were a few).

### The Video
Head over to [Notes in 9.com](http://www.notesin9.com/) to check it out, or watch it embedded here or on YouTube.

### Summary
In my opinion, this helps to complete part of the greater picture of a developer's workflow. It brings in some advanced tooling to assist the developer which, once set up, makes the repetitive tasks far more manageable and consistent. There will be more on the themes of task runners and project scaffolding in the future, but until then, :beers:.
