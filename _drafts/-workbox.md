Pardon the interruption in the Alexa Skill and serverless series, but a couple of things happened. First, I started using the next version of the Alexa SDK for node.js. Second, I saw an excellent Alexa Skill Developer promotion that I had to write a new skill for, so that took up my free time in October, other than working on my kid's Halloween costume; I'll be updating my next post in the series to reflect the new API. Lastly, I've started diving into improved configurations of [service workers][sw-url], which has led me to be a firm proponent of [workbox][workbox-url].
