TL;DR: I had some trouble with GitHub Pages and took the opportunity to try and migrate my blog to Netlify. Not only did it go smoothly and quickly, I'm happy with what I've gained in the process. Not every one of my personal sites will migrate, but new ones of any actual complexity likely will wind up there.

### Why?

- GH Pages wasn't building, with little to no info
- incl. after upgrading all sec deps which GH informed me of on the project homepage

#### What Were The Alternatives?

- GH Pages... wait until it resolved or change the process entirely
- Travis CI, free and powerful, requires more config writing (negligable) and deploy to gh-pages branch
- GitLab Pages - much more in line with Travis CI, except self-host on the GitLab Pages instance of GitLab.com; a great option, but would require moving to GitLab for a blog I've traditionally kept on GitHub (for open accessibility)
- purely static, self process the pages
- now.sh - great and preferred option, but would need to pay money for custom domain name (if anyone can show me how to do so w/ my free account, please do)
- Netlify - automagic deploys from git (GitHub) source, raved about on Syntax.fm, been on my radar for a while, figured I'd see if I could migrate before GH Pages "fixed itself"; spoiler alert, it was much faster

#### What It Isn't

#### Additional Superpowers

- PR / deploy previews - links on GitHub PRs
- split testing - A/B for previews of site across branch(s), etc.
- custom forms (for static sites)
