### Introduction
The eagle-eyed of you may have caught on to my thorough appreciate for George R.R. Martin's works in his <a href="//www.georgerrmartin.com/book-category/?cat=song-of-ice-and-fire">A Song of Ice and Fire book series</a> and the <a href="//www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones">HBO TV series adaptation, A Game of Thrones</a> (from the title of the first book). I'm going to be using some characters and houses from the series/show to populate values in my application I'll be building in this series.

### My Army for a House
The intent of my application is two-fold; tracking of the characters affiliations with the major houses of Westeros, and the relationships between characters and houses.
