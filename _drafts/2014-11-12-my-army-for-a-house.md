### Introduction
This is the introduction to my series on building an application highlighting Java model and controller classes for definitions and major workflow and associations with application layer implementations in XPages with beans and via RESTful/servlet interaction with AngularJS. This should highlight the advantage of a more robust Java layer, which makes the application layer, regardless of which way you go, much more flexible.

The eagle-eyed of you may have caught on to my thorough appreciate for George R.R. Martin's works in his <a href="//www.georgerrmartin.com/book-category/?cat=song-of-ice-and-fire">A Song of Ice and Fire book series</a> and the <a href="//www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones">HBO TV series adaptation, A Game of Thrones</a> (from the title of the first book). I'm going to be using some characters and houses from the series/show to populate values in my application I'll be building in this series.

So, without further ado, here is the ground work for Swords 4 Hire.

### A House
The intent of my application is two-fold; tracking of the characters affiliations with the major houses of Westeros, and the relationships between characters and houses.
