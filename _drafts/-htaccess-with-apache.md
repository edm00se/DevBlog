### Speed and Performance
My [last post on Nginx]({{ site.url }}/nginx/brief-intro-to-nginx) configuration as a reverse proxy received some decent traffic for my blog. In that post, I showed how to install and use Nginx as a reverse proxy and provide compression via _gzip_ to our server responses. This increases the speed of a server response being downloaded, making the overall speed, in most cases, faster. I started tracking down some of those speed and performance issues on two sites I help manage. They both use WordPress on shared hosting from a popular provider, so while they do the job, they can be less than blazing fast. What follows is how I was able to measure, identify, and fix this.
