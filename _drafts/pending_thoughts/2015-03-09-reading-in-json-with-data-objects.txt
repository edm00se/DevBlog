<!--
I should warn you that, up until now, I've stuck to an approach which has been, by exception, very <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="does vanilla get a bad rap?">vanilla</span>. From here forward, you'll see some opinionated approaches, so just keep that in mind. There's nothing wrong with establishing and using an opinionated approach to development, we should just be conscious of those decisions and aware of any affiliated limitations or constraints set thereof.

#### RESTful API Servlets and DDS
REST is a format I've talked about before, and while I won't dive too much into the specifics of why here, but I can say that my opinion on use of Domino Data Servies (DDS) has shifted. In my previous post, [REST is Best]({{ site.url }}/xpages/rest-is-best/)), I recommended that, if possible, to use DDS. My current take is that DDS is a great _short-hand_ way of implementing your NSF DB to your front-end. It gives you access and will perform the DB CRUD operations against a Document or View/Folder endpoint. Why I believe it's _short-hand_ in that it does not allow you to provision in business logic or validation during those operations. So, you can absolutely use it, but you should absolutely know that you're exposing direct CRUD operations to any connected (and authenticated, assuming no Anonymous access) web browser. In the end, this should be between you, the developer, and your administrators.

Beware, the next section gets theory heavy.

#### A Scenario
Consider the following: you want to provide a collection view of a listing of documents but only to reference, not to handle the CRUD operations; those you want to only interact with that particular document's endpoint (in the style of /collection/{:id}). This seems to be more preferable to me, as mass deletes and edits are less likely (from my expectations), with only limited (GET) operations at the collection (View) level.

The operations map to what DDS provides, except where it is my impression that it's essentially a "get it all" approach; I don't believe there's an easy way to enact the desired behavior in the scenario. The easiest seems to me, to be a hybrid approach, with DDS providing the View/collection responses, and a custom servlet to handle the document interaction. The problem would be locking down what DDS allows, as even with "Views only" marked in the Application Properties (as opposed to Views and Documents), it will still allow for the full CRUD operations agains the View/Folder endpoints (/api/data/collections/...).

It's worth mentioning that creating JSON from a View or Document is relatively easy, so a custom collection endpoint from a servlet isn't that much more difficult, as we're already provisioning an endpoint for the individual document (/collection/{:id} style); more below. The next paragraph outlines a way of making DDS behave in a way we _could_ want (which I **do not recommend** unless you _need to_ do it that way), but after that paragraph, I'm going the strictly custom servlet way for the remainder of this series (it's for-reference, which illustrates my current general frustrations with DDS).

To lock that down may require some admin-y work. In Brad Balassaitis's recent series on [Gridx in XPages](//xcellerant.net/gridx-in-xpages/) (one of a number of great blog series, and posts in general, from Brad), Brad [showed how to enable the PATCH method](//xcellerant.net/2015/02/10/gridx-in-xpages-31-saving-inline-edits/) for use with DDS. So, in this same method of interacting with the Web Site document to allow PATCH operations, we could also lock down the server's provision of anything other than GET operations (or just GET and PATCH, to allow for updating records from a View endpoint, without overriding the full set of the document's values).

Obviously this topic can get to be rather opinionated, not just in theory, but also in practice. So while my stance on the subject has changed over the last (+/-)year, I feel it's for the best, though I won't begrudge anyone for disagreeing with me. This just outlines the basics of my reasoning.

#### Jackson
To use Jackson, which I've avoided for the most part, I really recommend just [reading Frank van der Linden's blog post](//elstarit.nl/?p=242) on it. The short version is, Jackson can do this for you, via a JSON _ObjectMapper_.
