### An Observation
As an XPages development community, there has been significant effort spent on defining what XPages development should progress is and, since we all like to improve on efficiency, what to do or not do. It's great conversation and it's definitely aided me in a lot of ways. I can also say that I _think_ I have some unique perspective. Why? Because though I have experience with Java since 1.4, a bit of a background (in school) with WebSphere and DB2; in fact, <a href="//instagram.com/p/eLZY9yDNFQ/">it's amazing what one finds while clearing out the basement</a>.
