### Happy ðŸŽ‚ Day IE 11!

On the 17th of October in 2013, Internet Explorer 11 was released from Microsoft. That means that as of today, this popular\* browser is now four years old and, with all respect to it, it really ought to go.

What makes a browser, or any software for that matter, [evergreen][evergreen-about]? Well,

### Summary

The ultimate intent of this post is to stress the importance of what we need a web browser to do. Ultimately, just as [Continuous Integration (CI)][ci-about] has led to great advances in how we accomplish development along with its testing and release processes through sheer flexibility, consistency, and immediacy; we also should look for those qualities in our web browser(s). If a browser grows stale or sluggish in its release cycle (such as non-evergreen browsers), then we all suffer for its inability to respond to security threats, release with the known evolving specifications from [W3C][w3c-about] and [TC39][tc39-about]. It's not just about having the new and shiny, it's also about assurance of response to security threats and adapting to the direction of the web.

In the end, the question I've been asking myself is:

> How do we get from _needing to support IE(11)_ to the bright future where we don't have to care if a browser vendor allows itself to go out of date?

I'm fairly certain this will need to be [grassroots][grassroots-about] in nature. We need to "bubble up" our need to move on from inflexible browsers; previously, I would include something like the [browse happy][browse-happy] include (\*this is limited, as it is generally detecting IE specifically) and point those with outdated browsers to it, but it still lists IE 11; part of what I'm trying to avoid.

\*Note: I don't mean to hate on IE, rather Microsoft has moved on with Edge and while they have taken a very business stance of supporting IE for a longer time than I would prefer, but it's for their business customers who have locked-in requirements of older software requiring, say, IE 7 ðŸ˜’. This is rather meant to highlight the need for us as the development community to force the
