### Intro
I've gone through a couple rounds of preferences when it comes to self-hosted source control servers in the past couple years. I'm going to break down what I like about externally hosted solutions and then get into the benefits and trade-offs of a few of the (freely available) self-hosted solutions.

### Externally Hosted
There are two major players in the externally hosted (free) realm. There are more, but these are the big ones.

##### GitHub
asdf
https://github.com/about
only git
any private repos or enterprise hosting are $$$
de facto solution for the Open Source community

##### Bitbucket
asdf
https://bitbucket.org/
git and mercurial
unlimited private repos, w/ >= 5 collaborators for free
additional enterprise hosted options at different scales
strong stewardship and guides + articles (Atlassian) and parent co has SourceTree

##### Winner?
What are you looking for?

### Self-Hosting
