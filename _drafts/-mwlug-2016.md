### Intro
I'm speaking at MWLUG 2016! I'm really happy to go back to MWLUG. 

### Covering
asdf

#### The Abstract
> Watch, listen, and feel free to follow-along with a full-stack approach to how to build better applications with Domino/XPages, MVC principles in action in the back-end, RESTful API creation, along with MV* framework implementation in the front-end, with advanced tooling to help automate our coding process, unit tests, and even the ability to mock the back-end for front-end development outside of Domino Designer. This session seeks to help developers advance their workflow and produce higher quality, more performant and optimized applications with the Domino server they already have and the modern front-end tooling they want to incorporate.

### My Goals
