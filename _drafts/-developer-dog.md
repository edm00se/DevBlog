### Intro

Have you gotten past your fears of an always listening device on in your home? Has conversational computing started to change how you think about software development? Have you wanted to build your first Alexa Skill, with more than a simple "hello world"?

Amazon's Alexa (Echo) devices and services, along with Google's Home line of voice/audio products, have helped to begin a bit of a minor revolution. This one doesn't require singing and dancing, unless that's your thing, but rather that we re-examine the nature of how we interact with computing devices. The very nature of being able to speak aloud, give instruction in a natural langauge format, and receive information is probably one of the more underrated paradigm shifts of this decade. With any luck, it will only go onwards and upwards from here... unless skynet takes over.
