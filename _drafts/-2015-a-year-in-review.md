### Looking Back
In 2015, I posted to this blog 35 times, spoken at IBM ConnectED and MWLUG, and created three Notes in 9 videos covering topics from general application structure, to *HttpServlet*s to front-end development topics and things in-between (like front-end asset caching and HTTPS termination via a reverse proxy). I've gone wide afield in my quest, but that's by design. This quest I've been on is an attempt to establish some of my preferred practices in developing Domino/XPages applications, it's for the good of app. dev., for me, for selling concepts to my management, for pushing myself to be a better developer, and for sharing what I've learned that others might not need to go through some of the same foot work.

### What's To Come
