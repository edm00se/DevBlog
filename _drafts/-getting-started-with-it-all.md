Hello Petter.

I'm glad you've been enjoying the blog posts. I'm usually up for answering questions, on Twitter, StackOverflow, or in the XPages Slack chat, so I should be easy enough to get ahold of.

As for getting set up, since any attendees to my session may be in the same boat as yourself, I'm going to take the opportunity to write up a post with a couple references on how to do the an initial app setup, for someone new to many of the parts, like you're describing.

To get you started, I recommend:
- watching the Notes in 9 video that got me started with Git with Domino/XPages, episodes 131 and 140, the content of both by David Leedy
- installing Git (and SourceTree)
- installing Node from nodejs.org (this ensures that npm is available, I tend to install the LTS version of Node)

Everything else I can suggest builds on those, with the exception of JS IDE. I'm personally a SublimeText person, but I know several people that absolutely love WebStorm as it has some advanced integration I'm a bit jealous of, though most of what I want can be done in task runners, so I've been happy enough. The couple of times I've tried out Atom have been mixed, but my work machine is about to be replaced, so it may perform better for you.

That should probably be enough to get you started before the actual application development. Once you're up to speed on using git (like David shows, which is what I do) with DDE, then you may wish to read the portion of my readme from the GitHub repository for my task runners series called "Basic Project Layout" (link below), the portion where I describe my folder structure and how it relates to the On Disk Project.

I have yet to try out React yet, so I'm not 100% how that fits into the picture for you. Provided you're able to use it as any other (client-side) JavaScript component, you should be fine.

Let me know if you have further questions. Also, what may be the trickiest part, the git + On Disk Project (ODP) relationship is something that most other XPages developers deal with, so don't hesitate to ask questions in the XPages Slack chat (which you should join, in case you haven't).

I forgot to mention, you should also install the Swiper plugin for Domino Designer, as it simplifies what is output to the On Disk Project. Make sure to use the latest (1.0.2) version.
