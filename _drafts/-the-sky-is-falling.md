### The Sky is Falling

To some, it might seem as if "the sky is falling" is being cried from the rooftops. For those of us who develop in the XPages and Domino space, there have been rumors following apparent silence and a fair number of seemingly mixed signals. My first "LotusSphere" was IBM ConnectED (2015). At the time, there were some I met or had recently gotten to know who had expressed combinations of surprise, disbelief, hope, and skepticism regarding the future of LotusSphere and the Domino platform for app dev. A year later, I was quite happy to attend a more "upbeat" Connect (this year); one which saw application development on Domino (in XPages) front-and-center during the general opening session, which was great, but also it seemed that there were serious efforts both made and discussed with many.

Not to go too far into details, but seeing a live release of the XPages Extension library during a session on how to contribute to the ExtLib and ExtLibX projects; it was v901_16, that even saw inclusion of [my (humble, first) Pull Request to the ExtLib](https://github.com/OpenNTF/XPagesExtensionLibrary/pull/35). This sort of open inclusion was positive, especially in light of the inclusion of other things, such as Bluemix's XPages runtime going from experimental to beta during the calendar year meant that things were progressing.

Months later, with the conference high fading, many people have speculated as to what the utility of the XPages runtime on Bluemix may have in a "full production" scenario. Some have questioned the future of Domino and XPages itself. This can be a bit of an uncomfortable topic for many, as many people have been developing on the Domino platform for considerably longer than myself. It's easy to get attached to the familiar, but some days it seems to me that my entire life has been built on the concept of the evolutionary process.

### Evolution

One of the cornerstones of both the Socratic method, and the scientific method, is that we need to continually question, reassess, and challenge our own preconceptions in order to improve on our processes, theorems, and ultimately, ourselves. In the world of software, we have seen seemingly exponential growth in mere options of platforms and frameworks upon and with which to develop. Questioning what we already take for granted isn't a bad thing.

When it comes to Domino in the realm of "what have you done for me lately", yes, we have suffered through some quiet times and uncertainty. But, with necessity being the mother of invention, I believe we're at a crossroads of sorts; this is two-fold, both for ourselves and for the XPages platform. As far as where things are going, or at least where than _can_ go, we find that now, more than ever, the XPages runtime could shed some of the
