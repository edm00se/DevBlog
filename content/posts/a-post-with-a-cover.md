description: "Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible. Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions."

Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted
document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking
like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. 

While Markdown's syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters -- including [Setext](https://docutils.sourceforge.net/mirror/setext.html), [atx](https://www.aaronsw.com/2002/atx/), [Textile](https://textism.com/tools/textile/), [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html),
[Grutatext](https://www.triptico.com/software/grutatxt.html), and [EtText](https://ettext.taint.org/doc/) -- the single biggest source of
inspiration for Markdown's syntax is the format of plain text email.
