### Welcome to the Development Blog of @edm00se.

This is the landing place for my person trials, tribulations, and triumphs in regards to:

* to my day job
* IBM/Lotus Domino/XPages
* AngularJS
* NodeJS and Express
* Source Control
* and more

### A Promise
I can promise only to post something worthwhile to other developers of beginner to intermediate skill levels, that are (hopefully) interesting, and don't make me sound like a rambling idiot. Time will tell on that last one.

For starters, you can find my ramblings across the Intarwebs via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/edm00se), [GitHub](http://edm00se.github.io/), [and more](http://about.me/EricMcCormick).
